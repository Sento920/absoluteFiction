Absolute Fiction is a game.


That game is in concept:

A 4 person battle team, in the realm of the original "final fantasy".

However, this game is going to be multiplayer, with a user generated single player.

Multiplayer (concept):
    2 player battles of 4v4 teams.
    Beyond that is all up in the air.
    
Singleplayer (concept):
    Users can generate content themselves through text files ending in .af
    These will be read in through the game itself, and can be interpreted as thus.
    Pre-existing code exists for reading this in, through a project called BleakVirtualMachine.
        -This code will need editing.
    
    Minimum Viable Product:
        Reading in a file, to generate a story the user can play through, Without Battles.
        
    Secondary Viable Product:
        Reading in a file, and generating a story with save system and battles.
        
    Tertiary Viable Product:
        Multiplayer using Uwecsocket code.
        
    Final Product:
        Visual GUI.
    

    
    All or none of these may happen and are subject to change at any time.
